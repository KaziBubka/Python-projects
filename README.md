# Python-projects

### This repository is to showcase some of the programs I've created using Python

### Rolling_Dice 
Asks the user for an integer input, and returns a random integer between 0 and the user's input. Simulates a rolling dice

### Converters (with checks)
Currency converter (USD to CAD), Temperature converter (Fahrenheit to Celcius), Rolling dice and Circle area calculator.
These programs ask for user inputs and use the inputs to perform calculations. Checks are performed to handle errors in user input.

### Grade Calculator

User is then asked for the name of the student(s) whose grades they are interested in viewing.
